                <h3>Synthesis:</h3>
                <p>	The tasks I did during my practicum can be divided into various parts, as work was assigned whenever needed. The early parts of my practicum were mostly self-paced as I was added to the Digital IT Human Dev Team while they were working on a project and I was mostly assigned to test and record demonstrations of IT Human links with the issues of disconnection thought to be due to the sites being hosted in Europe causing issues. One thing of note regarding the disconnections, is that they weren’t present when we tested the sites at the Zuellig office. 
                    <br><br>
                    Most of the technical work I’ve done started when I was given proper access to watsonx assistant, and I was able to learn how setting up chatbots work in general. I found that a lot of factors were involved and my presumptions on watsonx and IT Human being the same were proven to be false once I started observing how to set up dialogs for the project assigned to me. This is because when I set up my own watsonx account, it was a trial account as I wasn’t given access yet to the projects at the time and I was searching on how the set up for the Digital Human was done. After the KTT was done on June 10, I found using watsonx assistant to be smooth and easy as the overall system implemented by IBM made setting up dialogs easy.
                    <br><br>
                    The skills I’ve obtained during the practicum would help me once I join the workforce, as I gain a better understanding of the overall process of creating software for clients such as the steps taken, and coordination for the various tasks needed. Unfortunately, my internship was done before another phase of the project that I could have potentially been involved with as I was initially asked to join at that part. The supervisors at my practicum were helpful whenever I had questions or concerns regarding documentation or the tasks assigned to me. 
                    <br><br>
                    The work from home nature of my practicum also made me realize the importance of time management for tasks, as my tasks during my practicum would at times overlap with prior commitments. However, I prioritized the tasks at my practicum as my job was on standby until I was assigned tasks. This made me learn to schedule some of my commitments around the hours I was assigned to work in. 
                    <br><br>
                    All in all, I’ve learned a lot about the process of deploying products for clients, and my experience with creating and testing demos for IT Humans helped me gain a better understanding of the process in a professional setting. It also helped me learn how much I need to understand in the entire software development process and I hope I can continue to learn and improve in areas that would help me become a Software Engineer in the future.
